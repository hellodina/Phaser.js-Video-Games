# Magic Eight Ball
You’ve learned a powerful tool in JavaScript: control flow! It’s so powerful, in fact, that it can be used to tell someone’s fortune.

In this project we will build a Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.

The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.
