# Team Stats

basketball, soccer, tennis, or water polo, but I'll decide which sport to focus on. My job is to use JavaScript data structures like arrays and objects to manage this data.

Once I've set up these data structures, I'll challenge myself to extract insights from them. For instance, I might calculate the total number of games my team has played or determine the average score of all their games. This project will help me practice manipulating data structures and extracting meaningful information from them.
