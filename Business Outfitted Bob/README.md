**Business Outfitted Bob**
There are several files with starter code in a project folder for a currently unfinished and unplayable browser-based game. This game will use JavaScript and more specifically, a library, called Phaser.js. Phaser makes it easy and fast to create games like Business Outfitted Bob by bundling together JavaScript code needed for games so you can focus on building other, more important parts of your project. This will be your first time seeing Phaser code but you will not need to know it or use it to complete this project.

You will need to draw on what youâ€™ve learned so far about JavaScript to complete Business Outfitted Bob:

Declaration of global variables and keywords like const and let
Changing the values of variables
Conditional statements using if, else if, and else
Once the missing JavaScript code has been added in certain files, all the features of the game will be complete and you will be able to play the game.
