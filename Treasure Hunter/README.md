# Treasure Hunter
The premise of the game is that there is a grid outlined on the screen. Within that grid, there are plots that have the possibility of containing a golden coin. The player and computer take turns clicking on plots to reveal what is there and the first treasure hunter to get to 5 coins wins the game!
